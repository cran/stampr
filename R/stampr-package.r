#' stampr: Spatial Temporal Analysis of Moving Polygons
#'
#' The Package \code{stampr} provides tools for performing spatial temporal analysis of moving polygons.
#' These tools allow the calculation of directional relationships, distance relations, and other basic
#' functionality, such as global change metrics. More details about each of these functions
#' can be found in its help documentation.
#'
#' \code{stampr}'s functions utilize the \code{sf} objects (as of version 0.3.0) from the 
#' package \code{sf}. Polygon relationships are still understudied in the field of 
#' geographic information science, but hopefully \code{stampr} can provide users with a
#' platform for new developments and applied research looking at interesting geographical phenomena.
